# React

## Create react app (JS):

```bash
>> npx create-react-app .
```
The “.” creates the folder inside the one you're currently on

## Create react app (TypeScript):
```bash
>> npx create-react-app . --template typescript
```

Create react app (Vite):

I personaly prefer Vite

Really recommend to see the documentation (pretty good one)

But if you’re wanting to get more advanced, jump right in to Next.JS

Another thing, I recommend `yarn` instead of `npm`

```bash
>> npm create vite@latest
```
or
```bash
>> yarn create vite
```

## Run code 🏃‍♂️:

```bash
>> npm start
```
or
```bash
>> yarn start
```

## Routes 🗺:
```bash
>> npm install react-router-dom  
```
or
```bash
>> yarn add react-router-dom
```
